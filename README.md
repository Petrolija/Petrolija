Hi there, my name is Petar (eng. Peter)

I'm a high school student specializing in IT as an Electrical Technician. As an exceptional student with a deep passion for computers, I find some video games truly fascinating. I'm capable of working independently but also thrive in collaborative environments with like-minded people. I'm eager to learn and participate in projects like game jams, where creativity meets technical skills.

I believe the best way to solve a problem is to encounter it firsthand and resolve it through dedication and research, with minimal help from friends when needed. This mindset drives my approach to both learning and project development.

I have experience working with HTML, C++, and C, which has given me a strong foundation in both web development and lower-level programming. Additionally, I am fluent in English and possess advanced language skills, allowing me to communicate effectively in international projects.

### Skills: 
-HTML, C++, C programming
-Programming logic and fundamentals
-Problem-solving and analytical thinking
-Team collaboration
-Solo project development
-Advanced English (fluent speaker)
-Rapid learning and adaptation
-Self-driven problem-solving

I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills, especially in game development and related technologies.
